                Wishing you the very, very, very, very <strong>happiest of 19th birthdays!</strong>
                <br><br>
                Know that I'm cheering you on from over here, hoping you have the best celebrations, spend time with Mum and Winnie and Harry, and wishing that I could be there to tell you how proud I am of you in person.<br><br>
                I say it every year, but I cannot belive my little sister is another year older - you can't be 19 yet, it feels just a tad bit crazy. In the past year however, you have done so many amazing things and all of us are so incredibly proud of you. From crushing uni, to your own travels, to being a rowing legend, and dealing with the crazy humans in this world.<br><br>
                In short, I miss you Millie, you have made being 18 an amazing time of your life and I have no doubt you will make the next year even better. <br>Looking forward to seeing you again, hugs, stories, and chill nights. Have an amazing birthday!
